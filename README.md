### Description
**"Brain Games"** is a set of five console games inspired by popular mobile brain-pumping apps. Each game asks questions to be answered correctly. Once three correct answers are given, the game ends. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt you to play it again. The games are:

- **Calculator.** Calculate random arithmetic expressions. Launched with `brain-calc`.
- **Progression.** Find missing numbers in a number sequence. Launched with `brain-progression`.
- **Determining an even number**. Launched with `brain-even`.
- **Determining the greatest common divisor**. Launched with `brain-gcd`.
- **Determining a prime number**. Launched with `brain-prime`.

Also, with `brain-games` command greeting with a name which a user inserts can be performed.
